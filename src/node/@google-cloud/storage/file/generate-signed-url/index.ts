/**
 * Generates a signed URL that provides temporary access to a file in Google Cloud Storage.
 *
 * This function generates a signed URL for the file located at `sourcePath` in the given bucket. The signed URL 
 * allows users to perform an action on the file (e.g., `read`, `write`) for a limited time as defined by the `expiresOn` parameter.
 * The behavior can be customized using optional `fileOptions` and `getSignedUrlOptions`.
 *
 * @param {string} sourcePath - The path of the file for which the signed URL is being generated.
 * @param {Bucket} bucket - The Google Cloud Storage bucket object containing the file.
 * @param {GetSignedUrlConfig['action']} action - The action allowed by the signed URL (e.g., 'read', 'write', 'delete').
 * @param {GetSignedUrlConfig['expires']} expiresOn - The expiration time of the signed URL, after which it is no longer valid.
 * @param {GenerateSignedUrlOptions} [options] - Optional configuration options for generating the signed URL.
 * @returns {Promise<Outcome.Either<string, string>>} A promise that resolves to an `Outcome.Either`.
 * - On success: `Outcome.makeSuccess(url)` containing the generated signed URL.
 * - On failure: `Outcome.makeFailure(errStr)` with an error message if the signed URL generation fails.
